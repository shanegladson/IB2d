NOTE:

[1] Before running main2d.m, please run Make_Tub_Geometry_and_Initial_Concentration.m
        to create the input files for the simulation! :)

[2] This simulation has multiple (vertical) sections of horizontal flow (every other moving in same direction)
        to create shear at the interfaces, as prescribed in the script,
        "please_Compute_External_Forcing.m". 

[2] This example doesn't use the Boussinesq approximation - just for illustrative purposes 
        of what the KH-Instability qualitatively looks like

[3] Simulation at 512x1024 resolution takes about 7 hours to run on 2.7 GHz processor
