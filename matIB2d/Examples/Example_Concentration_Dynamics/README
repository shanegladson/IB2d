% ** To run a simulation... **

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

[1] Go into particular example folder

[2] Run the 'main2d.m' file

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% ** To visualize the VTK simulation data... **
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

[1] Use either open-source software:
         VisIt: https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit
         Paraview: https://www.paraview.org

[2] Video tutorial on data visualization in VisIt:

---> NOTE: on MACOS 11 and 12, you may get the following error in VisIt
         when trying to open the viz_IB2d folder:

    "The MetaData server running on localhost could not get the file list
        for the current directory"

    if that happens, you will need to open VisIt from the command to 
    circumvent this issue, e.g., 

    1) Open a terminal window
    2) Change directory to your viz_IB2d simulation data
    3) In your terminal, open VisIt, type: 
            /Applications/VisIt.app/Contents/Resources/bin/visit -gui 
                    (or the correct path based on where you installed VisIt)

[1] Rubberband_Constant_64:

    - a rubber band simulation with *constant* desorption rate of a 
        concentration gradient at a grid resolution of Nx=Ny=64 using an
        upwind advection scheme


[2] Rubberband_Limited_64:

    - a rubber band simulation with *limited* desorption rate of a 
        concentration gradient at a grid resolution of Nx=Ny=64
        with k_source = 0.1 and c_inf = 0.1 (see input2d file) using an
        upwind advection scheme

[3] Rubberband_Sink_64:

    - a rubber band simulation with *limited* desorption rate of a 
        concentration gradient at a grid resolution of Nx=Ny=64
        with k_source = -2.0 (see input2d file) using an upwind
        advection scheme

[4] Moving_Cylinders_64:

    - a simulation of horizontally moving cylinders through a vertical 
        concentration strip while absorbing the concentration with a grid 
        resolution of Nx=Ny=64 with k_source = -1.0 (see input2d file) 
        using a 3rd-order WENO advection scheme

[5] Leaf_64:

    - a simulation of flow past a flexible plate behind a tiny rigid cylinder,
      in the vein of Turok-Hron, where the geometry gives off heat at a 
      constant rate with k_source = 1.0 (see input2d file) using an
      upwind advection scheme in a Eulerian (fluid) grid of size [Lx,Ly]=[5,30] 
      and resolution (Nx,Ny)=(64,384)

    - NOTE: from the manuscript simulation, the following changes were made
            in input2d (besides the grid resolutions):
                - the final time was reduced from 15s to 3.25s
                - k_source was reduced from 204400 to 2
                - kDiff was reduced from 0.23 to 0.01

[6] Coral_64:

    - a simulation of a pulsing coral polyp, where polyp emits a chemical 
      using a limited rate model with k_source = 0.0215 (see input2d file) using an
      upwind advection scheme in a Eulerian (fluid) grid of size [Lx,Ly]=[2,5] 
      and resolution (Nx,Ny)=(64,160)
